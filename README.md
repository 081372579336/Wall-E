### Introduction

Wall-E is a modern Jekyll template with a magazine-like grid layout on the frontpage (with optional feature images per post), beautiful typography with League Gothic and Open Sans. The theme is content first, meaning more emphasis is placed on the text than anything else. The UI is designed with Semantic UI.
